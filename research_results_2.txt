  · The language offers the implicit type cast (even from string to a number). · Local variables are not initialized automatically (except for strings). · Common local arrays are automatically deleted. Special Functions init, start and deinit

            The MQL4 language contained only three predefined functions that could be used in the indicator,
               script or Expert Advisor (not taking into account the include files *.mqh and library files). In MQL5
             there are no such functions, but there are their analogues. The  table shows  the approximate
             correspondence of functions. MQL4                                MQL5

                  init                                               OnInit

                start                                          OnStart

                deinit                                          OnDeinit

             Functions OnInit and OnDeinit perform the same role as init and deinit in MQL4 - they are designed to
              locate the code, which must be performed during initialization and deinitialization of mql5 programs. You can either just rename these functions accordingly, or leave them as they are, but add calls of
             these functions in corresponding places. init();

                deinit();

            The start function is replaced by OnStart only in scripts. In Expert Advisors and indicators it should be
            renamed to OnTick and OnCalculate, respectively. The code that is to be executed during a mql5
            program operation should be located in these three functions:

             mql5-program                             main function

                 script                                          OnStart

        Event Handling

            The MQL5 language provides handling of certain predefined events. The functions for handling these
             events should be defined in an MQL5 program: function name, return type, a set of parameters (if
             any) and their types should strictly correspond to the description of an event handling function. The client terminal event handler uses the return and parameter types to identify functions processing
            an event. If a certain function has some parameters or a return type not corresponding to the
              descriptions below, such a function cannot be used for handling an event. Function                     Description

               OnStart                   The function  is  called when the Start event occurs to perform
                                               actions set in the script

    Suppose we have a DoMath function that performs lengthy calculations (probably, it
     is implemented in a separate library). In terms of user interface convenience and friendliness, it would
     be great to show the user a progress indication. For this purpose, you can define a special type of
     function pointer for notifications about the percentage of work completed (ProgressCallback), and add a
     parameter of this type to the DoMath function. In the DoMath code, you should periodically call the
     passed function:

        typedef void (*ProgressCallback)(const float percent);

        void DoMath(double &bigdata[], ProgressCallback callback)
           const int N = 1000000;
           for(int i = 0; i < N; ++i)
              if(i % 10000 == 0 && callback != NULL)
                 callback(i * 100.0f / N);

     Then the calling code can define the required callback function, pass a pointer to it to DoMath and
     receive updates as the calculation progresses. void MyCallback(const float percent)
           Print(percent);

           double data[] = {0};
           DoMath(data, MyCallback);

     Function pointers work only with custom functions defined in MQL5. They cannot point to built-in
     functions of the MQL5 API. §H3§2.8.11 Inlining§/H3§

     In order to improve code efficiency, modern compilers often use the following trick. When generating
     executable code, some function calls are replaced directly by the function body (its statements). This
     technique is called inlining. This speeds up the operation by avoiding the overhead associated with the
     organization of the call and return from the function. From a programmer's point of view, inlining
     doesn't change anything. MQL5 supports inlining by default. If necessary, it can be disabled, but only in code profiling mode....

    A pointer type defined with typedef can be returned from functions, for example:

        Calc generator(ushort type)
           switch(type)
              case '+': return plus;
              case '-': return minus;
           return NULL;

     In addition, the type of function pointers is often used for callback functions (callback, see
     FuncCallback.mq5). Suppose we have a DoMath function that performs lengthy calculations (probably, it

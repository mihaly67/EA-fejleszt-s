# Mimic Trap & DOM Analysis Report
**Date:** 2026.01.23 Session (GBPUSD)
**Log Files:** `Mimic_Trap_Log_GBPUSD_20260123_224130.csv` & `Hybrid_DOM_Log_GBPUSD_20260123_223848.csv`

## 1. Executive Summary
This analysis correlates **17 Manual Trap Executions** (Mimic Strategy) with high-frequency **DOM & Physics Data**.
*   **Strategy Execution:** 100% Success Rate in triggering the "3 Decoy -> 1 Trojan" sequence.
*   **Market Conditions:** High Spread Environment (~10.5 points), likely indicating low liquidity session (Friday close?).
*   **Key Findings:** The "Mimic" actions occurred across a wide spectrum of Orderbook imbalances, suggesting the user triggered traps regardless of static DOM pressure.

## 2. Trap Sequence Performance
Each sequence consists of **3 Decoy Trades** (0.01 Lot) followed immediately (<1s) by **1 Trojan Trade** (0.10 Lot).

| Seq # | Time | Spread (pts) | Velocity | DOM Ratio (Bid/Ask) | Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **#1** | 22:43:03 | 10.7 | 1.19 | 1.00 (Balanced) | Neutral |
| **#6** | 22:45:37 | 10.6 | 0.56 | **0.11 (Bearish)** | Heavy Sell Pressure in Book |
| **#9** | 22:46:42 | 10.4 | 0.47 | **10.20 (Bullish)** | Massive Buy Wall Support |
| **#15** | 22:50:00 | 10.8 | **4.54** | 0.56 (Bearish) | **High Velocity Spike** |

## 3. DOM & Physics Correlation
### A. Orderbook Imbalance
The strategy was executed in three distinct market states:
1.  **Balanced Book (Ratio ~1.0):** (e.g., Seq #1, #8, #17). The "Mimic" noise (Decoys) enters a stable market.
2.  **Heavy Asymmetry (Ratio > 2.0 or < 0.5):** (e.g., Seq #3, #6, #9). The user entered *against* or *with* significant passive liquidity.
    *   *Observation:* Seq #9 had 10x more Bids than Asks. If the trap was a SELL, it faced a wall. If BUY, it had support.

### B. Price Velocity (Sensitivity)
*   **Low Velocity (< 0.8):** Most entries occurred in calm markets.
*   **High Velocity (> 1.5):** Seq #7, #11, #15.
    *   **Critical Event (Seq #15):** Velocity spiked to **4.54 pips/sec** just before entry. This suggests the user reacted to a sudden breakout or news event manually.

### C. Liquidity Resilience (L1)
*   Top-of-Book (L1) volume remained consistently between **500k - 1M** units.
*   The "Decoy" trades (0.01 Lots) did not visibly deplete L1 liquidity (as expected, they are too small).
*   *Hypothesis:* The broker's algorithm likely ignored the Decoys due to size, but the timing (Rapid Fire) might still flag "Toxic Flow" if repeated often.

## 4. Recommendations
1.  **Filter by Spread:** The average spread of 10.5 pts is high for Scalping. Consider adding a `MaxSpread` filter to the EA to prevent accidental activation during illiquid times.
2.  **Velocity Trigger:** Seq #15 (High Velocity) represents a different regime than the others. The EA could log "Market Regime" (Calm vs Volatile) to segregate results.
3.  **Automated Correlation:** Future versions of `Mimic_Trap_EA` should log the `DOM_Imbalance_Ratio` at the moment of the trigger to automate this analysis.

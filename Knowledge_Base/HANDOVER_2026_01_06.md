## 🛑 Status Summary
*   **Color Reference Table:** ✅ **SUCCESS** (`v2.03`). Displays 140+ colors, grouped logically, with tooltips. Ready to use.
*   **Chart Designer EA:** 🔴 **FAILED** (`v2.04`). The GUI panel appears but buttons are missing/invisible, or the panel jumps around. The code became too complex with dynamic coordinate calculations.

## 🔄 Strategic Reset (Next Session)
**DO NOT continue patching `Chart_Designer_EA_v2.04.mq5`.**
The user explicitly requested a "Back to Basics" approach, similar to the successful WPR EA collaboration.

### 📋 Action Plan for Next Session:
1.  **Create New File:** `Chart_Designer_Simple_Panel.mq5`.
2.  **Phase 1: The Skeleton (Váz)**
    *   Implement a standard `CAppDialog`.
    *   Add **ONE** test button (e.g., "Test Button").
    *   Use **Relative Coordinates** (standard library usage), NOT absolute math.
    *   **Goal:** Verify the panel appears and the button is visible/clickable.
3.  **Phase 2: The Grid**
    *   Add the 5x5 (or 10x10) button grid using simple loops.
    *   **Goal:** Verify layout stability.
4.  **Phase 3: The Logic**
    *   Only *after* the GUI is perfect, wire up the `ChartSetInteger` color logic.

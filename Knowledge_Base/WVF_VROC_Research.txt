=== RESEARCH: Williams Vix Fix & VROC ===
Date: 2025-12-17

1. **Williams Vix Fix (WVF)**:
   - **Formula**: `WVF = (Highest(Close, n) - Low) / Highest(Close, n) * 100`
   - **Purpose**: A synthetic "VIX" for any asset.
   - **Interpretation**:
     - High values indicate "Market Fear" / Oversold conditions (Bottoms).
     - Low values indicate Complacency / Uptrend.
   - **Standard Period**: 22 (Monthly trading days), but for scalping, a shorter period (e.g., 20 or 50) might be better.
   - **Integration**: Add to `HybridVolatilityIndicator`. It complements the BB Squeeze (which detects low volatility). WVF detects *High Volatility Downside*.

2. **Volume Rate of Change (VROC)**:
   - **Formula**: `(Volume[0] - Volume[n]) / Volume[n] * 100`
   - **Purpose**: Measures the acceleration of volume.
   - **Interpretation**: Spike in VROC often precedes price breakouts.
   - **Integration**: Add to `HybridFlowIndicator`.
     - Current Flow: MFI + Delta.
     - New Flow: MFI + Delta + VROC.
     - **Visualization**: User said "what is unnecessary, don't bother".
     - *Decision*: Since `HybridFlow` handles Delta (Directional Volume), adding VROC (Speed of Volume) might be clutter if not careful.
     - *Hypothesis*: The user specifically asked for "WV F, VROC correctly". I must implement them.
     - *Method*: Add VROC as a line overlay on the `HybridFlow` window? Or separate?
     - *Better idea*: Use VROC to *color* the MFI line? Or add a simple "VROC Spike" marker?
     - *User Constraint*: "What depends on how it can be visualized".
     - *Plan*: I will add VROC as a colored line or histogram in `HybridFlow`. If it's too much, I'll make it toggleable. Actually, VROC is often noisy. A "Volume Surge" boolean indicator might be better.
     - *Refined Plan*: Focus on WVF first (HybridVolatility), then VROC (HybridFlow).

3. **HybridVolatility Upgrade**:
   - Rename to `HybridVolatilityIndicator_v1.1`.
   - Plot 1-3: BB (Existing).
   - Plot 4-5: Keltner (Existing).
   - Plot 6: WVF Histogram (New).
     - Location: Separate window? No, `HybridVolatility` is Chart Window (BB bands). WVF is an oscillator (0-100+).
     - *Conflict*: BB is on Chart, WVF is separate.
     - *Solution*: Split? Or create `Hybrid_WVF_VROC_Showcase.mq5`?
     - *User Preference*: "Hybrid System".
     - *Decision*: Modify `HybridVolatility` to be a "Panel" or keep purely on-chart?
     - *Correction*: Standard `HybridVolatility` (BB/KC) is on-chart. WVF *must* be separate window.
     - *Action*: Create `HybridVolatilityOscillator_v1.0.mq5` (WVF + maybe VROC here?).
     - *Alternative*: The user asked for "WVF, VROC... complete market picture".
     - *Synthesis*: Create a **Market Stress & Flow** indicator?
     - *Better*: Add VROC to `HybridFlow` (Separate Window). Add WVF to a new `HybridStressIndicator` (Separate Window) OR combine WVF into `HybridFlow` (as they are both oscillators)?
     - WVF is volatility/fear. Flow is money.
     - *Decision*:
       1. **HybridFlow v1.5**: Add VROC (Optional Line).
       2. **HybridVolatility v1.1**: Use `ChartIndicatorAdd` to add a subwindow WVF? No, that's complex.
       3. **New Indicator**: `HybridFearIndicator_v1.0` (WVF).

   - *Wait*, `HybridVolatility` currently displays Bands. WVF is an oscillator. I cannot mix them in one file easily unless I use `ChartIndicatorAdd`.
   - **Plan B**: Create `Hybrid_WVF_Indicator.mq5` and user can stack it.
   - **Refined Plan**: I will update `HybridFlow` to include VROC (as it fits "Flow"). I will create a standalone `HybridWVF` (as it fits "Volatility" but needs a window).

   - *Actually*, looking at the "Full Market Picture":
     1. Momentum (Oscillator)
     2. Flow (Oscillator)
     3. Context (Chart)
     4. Volatility (Chart - Bands)
     5. **Fear/Stress (WVF)** -> New Oscillator Window.

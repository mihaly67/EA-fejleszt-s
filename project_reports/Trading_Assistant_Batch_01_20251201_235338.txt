            This module is based on the assumption that the efficiency of market models changes in time. Using
             this module, you can filter signals received from the other modules by hour and days of week. It allows
            increasing the quality of generated signals due to cutting off the unfavorable time periods. The

Taking into account new information about different ways of comparing and simultaneously eliminating
 different types of keys in map arrays, we modify the match method. In it, for each specified property,
 we retrieve a condition from the conditions array based on the key in the data map array, and
 appropriate checks are performed using the switch operator. template<typename V>
       bool match(const SymbolMonitor &m, const MapArray<ENUM_ANY,V> &data) const
          static const V type = (V)NULL;
             const ENUM_ANY key = data.getKey(i);
             switch(conditions[key])
             case EQUAL:
                if(!equal(m.get(key, type), data.getValue(i))) return false;
             case NOT_EQUAL:
                if(equal(m.get(key, type), data.getValue(i))) return false;
             case GREATER:
                if(!greater(m.get(key, type), data.getValue(i))) return false;
             case LESS:
                if(greater(m.get(key, type), data.getValue(i))) return false;

 The new template greater method is implemented simplistically. static bool greater(const V v1, const V v2)
          return v1 > v2;

 Now the match method call can be written in a shorter form since the only remaining type of the
 template V is automatically determined by the passed data argument (and this is one of the arrays
 longs, doubles, or strings). void select(const bool watch, string &symbols[]) const
          const int n = SymbolsTotal(watch);
             const string s = S

Everything in the completed method and in the MqlTradeResultSync structure is ready for
 synchronous position closing tracking: the same algorithm worked for a normal closing of a position. else if(action == TRADE_ACTION_CLOSE_BY)
             return result.closed(timeout);

 Opposite positions are usually used as a replacement for a stop order or an attempt to take profit on a
 short-term correction while remaining in the market and following the main trend. The option of using a
 pseudo-stop order allows you to postpone the decision to actually close positions for some time,
 continuing the analysis of market movements expecting the price to reverse in the right direction. However, it should be kept in mind that "locked" positions require increased deposits and are subject to
 swaps. That is why it is difficult to imagine a trading strategy built on opposite positions in its pure
 form, which could serve as an example for this section. Let's develop the idea of the price-action bar-based strategy outlined in the previous example. The new
 Expert Advisor is TradeCloseBy.mq5. We will use the previous signal to enter the market upon detection of two consecutive candles that
 closed in the same direction. A function responsible for its formation is again GetTradeDirection. However, let's allow re-entries if the trend continues. The total maximum allowed number of positions
 will be set in the input variable PositionLimit, the default is 5. The GetMyPositions function will under
